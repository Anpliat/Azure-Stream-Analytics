# Azure Stream Analytics

#### Concept

We have gained access to a data stream generated by sensors installed at various checkpoints (toll stations and speed cameras). Each time a car passes by one of the checkpoints, an event is generated. All cars are equipped with tags that display the vehicleTypeID and colorID of each vehicle. Tag readers are capable of reading this information. In addition, a camera reads the license plate and completes the event’s data.
